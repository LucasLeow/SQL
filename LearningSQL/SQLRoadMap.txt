- Many concepts in SQL
- different jobs have different requirements
- basic | intermediate | advanced
- database dev
    - SQL alone not sufficient

1) Pre-requisites
    - SQL : To interact with Relational DB
    - Data stored within Relational DB
    - App require data, need to interact with relational DB to retrieve data
    - Several types of Relational DB
        - Oracle
        - MySQL
        - Microsoft SQL Server
        - Postgres
        - Cloudbased
            - Amazon Redshift
            - Snowflake etc.

        Which DB to choose?
            - does not matter
            - 80 - 90% SQL are similar (syntax | concepts)
            - can apply across
            - Slight differences (certain in-built functions different)
                - slight syntactical difference
        
            Preferences:
                - PostgresSQL
                    - free & lightweight
                    - need to install DB on system
                - If using cloud based, need to set-up
                - need IDE to connect to DB to perform operations
                - each have own IDE

                PostgresSQL : PgAdmin
                MySQL : MySQL WorkBench
                Oracle : SQL Developer

        

2) Basic SQL
    2.1) Concepts
        - What is relational DBMS
            - how data is stored
            - what is schema wrt relational db

        - SQL commands
            - DDL | DML | DCL | TCL | DQL
            - what commands do

        - Data Types
            - String (VARCHAR , TEXT)
            - Integer (INT, NUMBER)
            - DATE
            - FLOAT / DECIMAL
            - BOOLEAN
            - IDENTITY column (auto increment column)
        
        - Constraints
            - primary key
            - foreign key
            - Check constraint, Not null constraint, Unique constraint, Default etc.

        - Normalization in SQL
            - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF
            - benefits of Normalization

        - Operators
            - Arithmetic operator
            - Logical
            - Comparison
            - Union, Union all

        - Case statements
            - simple case + nested case
        
        - Important SQL clauses
            - DISTINCT
            - ORDER by
            - Limit / Top

        - Inner Join
            - Fetch data from multiple tables

3) Intermediate SQL

    - Concepts
        - Groupby & Having clause
        - Aggregate functions
            - min | max | avg | sum | count
        - Order of Execution
        - Sub-Queries
        - CTE Tables / WITH clause
        - ALL types of joins
            - LEFT | RIGHT | FULL OUTER | CROSS | SELF
        - In-built functions
            - String : Substring | Position | Coalesce
            - Date : Extract, To_Date
        - Window Functions
            - RANK | DENSE_RANK | ROW_NUMBER | LEAD | LAG
            - FIRST_VALUE | LAST_VALUE | NTH_VALUE
        - Views
