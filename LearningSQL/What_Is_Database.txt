Data:
    - essential in the modern technology world
    - success of company depend on how well data utilized
    - database to store data

    - Any information / fact can be considered data
        - name
        - age
        - date of birth
        - address
        - vehicle driven
        
        - Statistics
        - Mathematics
        - Details of School

        - Can be in any form
            - video
            - image
            - text
            - file
        

-- What is Database --
    - Used to store data
    - "container" filled with data
    - can easily access data
    - protect data
    - analyze data easily

eg: College Timesheet Web App
    - Staff Details
    - Timesheet Details
    - Student Attendance
    - Student marks
    etc.

- App connect to DB to modify / retrieve data

- Huge company need huge DB to store data
    - dedicated computers / hardware to store / manage data

-- DBMS --
    - DBMS != Database
    - Database is just container to store data

    Database Management System
        - Software to manage database
        - need DBMS to interact with DB
            - Store
            - Retrieve
            - Protect
            - Create | Modify | Delete DB
        - enter commands to interact with DB
    
-- Evolution of DB --
    - Flat File DB : 1960
        - Data stored in CSV etc.
    - Hierachical DB & Network DB 
        - Store data thru parent child r/s
        - incapable of storing complex data r/s

    - Relational DB
        - 74% used currently
        - slowly transiting to non-relational due to social media
        - Oracle most widely used
        - Data stored in tables
            - Each table have rows & cols
            - Each cols have name & data type (fields)
                - Only data that satisfy rule can be inserted in the col.
            - Each row treated as a record
        - Foreign Key constraints used to form r/s b/w tables
        - Info scattered across multiple tables linked by keys
        - SQL used in DBMS to manipulate DB
        - Most banks uses Relational DB


    - Non-Relational DB

        - Have multiple types of Non-relational DB:
            - Key-Value DB
                - aka key-value store
                - simplest of all non-r/s db
                - every data assigned a key
                - To retrieve data, just provide key
                - good for storing:
                    - config data
                    - state info
                    - any data represented by dict / hash
                    - eg: Redis | Memcached DB

            - Document DB  
                - aka document store
                - also use unique key
                - store data in structured format known as Document
                    - JSON
                    - VSAN
                    - XML format etc.
                - No specific format to follow
                - Each document have its own structure
                - Data can be queried & analyzed
                eg: MongoDB | CouchDB

            - Graph DB
                - forms r/s using nodes & edges properties
                - data represented by individual nodes
                    - each node can have multiple properties
                - edges used to represent connection
                - good for storing data that have r/s / connections b/w data
                    - facebook network connection
                - useful for searching specific pattern
                    - fraud detection
                    - money laundering
                eg: neo4j database
            
            - Wide Column DB
                - aka column family DB
                - use rows & cols
                - dont use tables
                - use column families
                    - each row have own structure / schema
                    - each row have unique row identifier
                    - each row can have differnt cols with different types of data
                    
            - Search Engine DB
            - Time Series DB 
            etc.

            - Each type store data differently

        - MongoDB most widely used

    Large companies use combination of relational & non-relational DB as required
